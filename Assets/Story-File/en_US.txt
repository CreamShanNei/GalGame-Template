Hello, my name is ShanNei.
As you can see, what you're looking at is a GalGame example made in Unity.
I haven't been into Unity for a long time, and I'm not very good at writing code.
If you have better ideas, you can submit an issue~
Project warehouse address: https://github.com/CreamShanNei/GalGame-Template
Hope this template can help you~
ShanNei not only did this
He is also the main person in charge of ZeroDream.
Or the COO of ELYART?
Next is a little story I wrote, Enjoy~
.
Once upon a time. . It's a beautiful world
But, one day, an evil devil
He encrypted this continent with a lock
Travelers are now required to travel between worlds
looking for that evil devil
Release the curse of this world.
